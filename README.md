# Real-Time-Programming-C-Project
## Description
This project involving reading data from a GPIO pin, and the main focus is on creating three methods of triggering and respond:
Software Trigger & Software Response, Hardware Trigger & Software Response, and Hardware Trigger & Hardware Response. There is a serial UI to choose between the three triggering modes. The functionality of the system is a simple counter triggered by a peripheral button. Even though the three modes of the system have the same functionality, the triggering and responding methods used are different. For Software Trigger & Software Response, a variable is needed to track the previous state of the button, so the edge of the signal can be detected. The polling period is the shortest in the three methods since the system can't miss any edge, which increases the CPU load. For Hardware Trigger & Software Response, the hardware flag is used to detect the signal edge, which increases the polling period since the flag only needs to be checked before the next edge happens. For the two methods above, the responses are written inside an if statements. Finally, for Hardware Trigger & Hardware Response, the Interrupt is used. The detection is done by the hardware, and the response is sent by the ISR, which results in the smallest CPU load.
